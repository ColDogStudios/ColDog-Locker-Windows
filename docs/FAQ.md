> # ColDog Locker FAQ

## Why does my password end up lowercase?

Due to CMD restrictions, variables, uppercase or lowercase, are interpreted the same. This results in a conflict with the encryption process forcing each letter to be lowercase.

## Why does ColDog Locker run with Administrator?

Access will be denied if it does not. Rest assured that ColDog Locker only runs in Administrator so that there are no authority conflicts with files and to fix the "Access is denied." message.
